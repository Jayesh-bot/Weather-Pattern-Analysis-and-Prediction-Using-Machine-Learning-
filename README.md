🌡 Temperature Classification using Machine Learning

A supervised multi-class classification project that predicts temperature categories — Cold, Mild, Hot — using global weather data. Multiple machine learning algorithms are trained, evaluated, and compared to identify the best-performing model.

📌 Overview

This project demonstrates a full end-to-end ML workflow including data preprocessing, feature engineering, visualization, model training, evaluation, and performance comparison. Temperature data is converted into class labels and machine learning models are trained to classify weather conditions effectively.

🧠 Project Objectives

Convert continuous temperature values into Cold / Mild / Hot categories.

Analyze dataset features using correlations and visualizations.

Train multiple ML models to compare prediction performance.

Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Visualize comparison results to determine the best model.
